### checkout 
`checkout`用来检出指定`branch`，`commit`

### 从当前分支检出并创建一个新的分支
```
$ git checkout -b checkoutBranch
Switched to a new branch 'checkoutBranch'
$ git status
On branch checkoutBranch
nothing to commit, working tree clean
```

### 切换分支
```
$ git checkout master
Switched to branch 'master'
Your branch is up to date with 'origin/master'.
$ git status
On branch master
Your branch is up to date with 'origin/master'.

nothing to commit, working tree clean
```

### 检出`commit`
```
$ git log

You are in 'detached HEAD' state. You can look around, make experimental
changes and commit them, and you can discard any commits you make in this
state without impacting any branches by switching back to a branch.

If you want to create a new branch to retain commits you create, you may
do so (now or later) by using -c with the switch command. Example:

  git switch -c <new-branch-name>

Or undo this operation with:

  git switch -

Turn off this advice by setting config variable advice.detachedHead to false

HEAD is now at 9587e12 Initial commit
```
提示在`detached HEAD`状态，意思是只有`HEAD`指向他，而没有任何分支指向它。
```
$ git status
HEAD detached at 9587e12
nothing to commit, working tree clean
```
